_"A map is not the territory"&mdash;Alfred Korzybski_

This is a minimal implementation of the server side of [JMAP][], the
JSON Meta Application Protocol.

[JMAP]: https://jmap.io/

It is intended to simplify prototyping new data models built on the JMAP
core protocol, not to be an efficient implementation of any particular
data model. There are other [production-grade servers][production] for
the email, calendar, or contacts data models.
